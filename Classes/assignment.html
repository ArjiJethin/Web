    <h2>Understanding Various Text Tags</h2>
    <p>
      In HTML there are two tags used to bold the text, they are
      <b>Bold Tag</b> and the other is <strong>Strong Tag</strong>. The main
      difference between <b>Bold Tag</b> and <strong>Strong Tag</strong> is b
      tag is used for styling purpose whereas the strong tag is used for telling
      the user that's an important block which we shouldn't miss. <br />
      The other two similar tags in HTML are <i>Italic or I Tag</i> and
      <em>Emphasis Tag</em>, even here the main difference between these two
      tags is same as the above case where <i>i tag or Italic tag</i> is used
      for stylings whereas, the
      <em
        >Emphasis tag is used to emphasize the text and makes the user look
        it</em
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of mark tag is to make the text background color to
      <mark>highlighted</mark> yellow color which grabs the attention of the
      user. The del tag stands for delete and it is used to strike over a
      <del>incorrect</del> text like this. And similarly, the ins tag stands for
      inserted text, it is used make the text underline, which looks like this
      <ins>corrected</ins>. The sub tag stands for subscript which is used for
      the text or formulas which contain base values like: H <sub>2</sub>O. The
      sup tag stands for superscript and it can be used for the power value in
      formulas for example X <sup>2</sup> or even for 3 <sup>rd</sup> sem.
