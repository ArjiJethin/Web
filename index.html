        In our universe, where water is a fundamental resource. Oceans play a

        Understanding the water cycle and its role in maintaining ecosystems is

        Kepler-138, also known as KOI-314, is a red dwarf located in the
        constellation Lyra, <b>219 light years from Earth</b>. It is located
        within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that
        NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets transiting their stars. The
        star hosts <mark> three confirmed planets and a likely fourth</mark>,
        including the lowest-mass exoplanet with a measured mass and size
        discovered to date, Kepler-138b, with a mass comparable to that of Mars.
        Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density; initially thought likely
        to be a gas dwarf,[8] more recent observations as of 2022 show that it,
        as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.

        "Kepler-138 c is a super Earth exoplanet that orbits an M-type star. Its
        mass is 2.3 Earths, it takes 13.8 days to complete one orbit of its
        star, and is 0.0913 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in
